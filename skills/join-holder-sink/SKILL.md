# Join the Pay Me Dividends holder sink

Route an **existing** Bankr token's trading fees to holders pro-rata via a Project Router and the shared RWA Hub.

Natural-language triggers:

- "Join the Pay Me Dividends holder sink"
- "Route my token fees to holders pro-rata"
- "I want my Bankr token in the shared RWA rewards pool"

**New token launches** are not this skill — send users to [app.paymedividends.xyz](https://app.paymedividends.xyz) (router + Bankr deploy with API key in browser).

## Who can use this

Only the wallet that is the **current Doppler fee beneficiary** for the token (≥95% share). Bankr resolves the user's wallet from their session/API key — never offer sink setup for tokens where they are not the beneficiary.

## Flow

1. Resolve wallet `W` from Bankr auth
2. `GET https://api.bankr.bot/public/doppler/beneficiary-fees/W`
3. Filter: `chain === "robinhood"`, share ≥ 95%, paired with an RWA/stock quote (not WETH-only)
4. User picks a token
5. On Robinhood Chain (4663):
   - Create router: `ProjectRouterFactory.createPrelaunchRouter(hub, …)`
   - Retarget fees: `POST https://api.bankr.bot/public/doppler/build-transfer-beneficiary` → sign `updateBeneficiary`
   - Verify: `getShares(poolId, router) >= 0.95e18`
6. `POST https://paymedividends-production.up.railway.app/v1/enrollment-requests` (or site wizard)
7. Governance Safe calls `enrollMemberRouter` → 7-day delay → `activateMemberRouter`

## APIs

See [references/api.md](references/api.md) for request/response details.

Proxy (optional): `GET /v1/bankr/beneficiary-fees/:wallet` on Pay Me Dividends API filters Robinhood stock-paired tokens.

## Must NOT do

- Router setup for non-beneficiary wallets
- Hub enrollment onchain (governance Safe only)
- Store user Bankr API keys server-side for the launch wizard

## Product rules

- Holder pro-rata only — no creator-fee wallet at launch
- Fee recipient = Project Router (holder sink)
- Shared Hub is governance-gated per RWA ecosystem pool
